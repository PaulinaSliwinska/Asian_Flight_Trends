# Asian Flight Trends Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing flight trends across Asia using data prepared with Excel or MySQL and visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. The analysis aims to identify booking patterns and customer preferences.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: Visualizations to explore and analyze trends with different dimensions like flight days, trip types, and booking lead times.
- **MySQL**: Database queries for data extraction and transformations.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards showcasing flight trends, customer behavior, sales channels and data preparation.

## Dashboards
The dashboards created in Tableau and Power BI provide insights into:
- Booking trends by region, flight day, and trip type.
- Customer preferences for additional services (extra baggage, meals, preferred seating).
- Sales channels (website, mobile app) and their booking volumes.

Both Power BI and Tableau dashboards are available as PDF exports for easy review, but I recommed to open the dashboards in apps.
